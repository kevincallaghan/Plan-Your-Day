# Plan Your Day - Day Planner by Kevin Callaghan

## Description

This planner can be used to save a description to each hour of the day so the user can organize and keep track of their day.  This can help you track what you need to get accomplished in a day and when you need to do it.  This planner also updates the current time and will reflect which time slots have already passed, what the current time slot is, and which time slots are in the future based on the background colors for each slot.  By creating this project using JQUERY, I learned a lot about traversing the DOM, particularly by using the parents and siblings method.  I also learned about using JQUERY to call items and add items, an example of which would be creating a click listener on the save-icons that looks for a sibling to add the description.
